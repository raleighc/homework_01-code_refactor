## Fixes Applied
HTML refactoring was used to replace all "div" tags with proper sematic tags to create more clarity in the code. Additionally, a descriptive title and alt selectors were added to photographs to help make the code meet accessibility standards.
CSS refactoring was used to complile properties to reduce redundancies. Property tags were also simplified to help with future upkeep and make the code much easier to read.
